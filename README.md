Howdy :wave:

I'm an NLP/ML consultant in Tokyo. A lot of my open source work is focused on making it easier to process Japanese text, which is probably why you're here. 

If my code has helped you, consider sponsoring me here on Github. If you need more help than I can offer in issues, or you need help with private code, you can [contact me](mailto:howdy@cotonoha.io) to discuss paid work.
